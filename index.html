      <h1>London Free Workspaces</h1>
      <p>There are more self-employed workers in London than ever. Some of us can't afford to pay for office spaces, and don't want to stay cooped up at home all day. Free work spaces aren't that obvious to find, they come in all shapes and sizes. As someone who quit their job to retrain in web development, I needed places that would offer peace, comfy chairs and desks, decent wifi and enough inspiration to keep me jumping out of bed each morning, I did some deep digging, and here’s what I found. I hope it helps, if you have any recommendations yourself, please get in touch :) </p>

        <h1>Southbank Centre</h1>

        <article>The Southbank Centre’s Royal Festival Hall is a grand and impressive space. Set right on the river, and just a few minutes walk form Waterloo station, it offers some inspiring views for you to take in from over your laptop. There are several levels of foyers that anyone can come and use for free, whether its meeting with colleagues, or studying solo. Most foyers are furnished with sofas / comfy chairs and / or tables and chairs for you to work at, and there is no pressure to buy anything. The only downside is there aren’t so many power sockets, so make sure you charge your laptop to be safe! I found some on the balcony overlooking the ground floor bar, and on one of the middle floor foyers. You just need to arrive early to make sure you get the best spot.

        <h1>Reubens Library, BFI.</h1>

        <article>Located on the south bank of the Thames, the Reubens Library is a perfect location to work if you want beautiful riverside views to step out onto for a break / meeting / lunch, and there are countless bars, restaurants, cafes and stalls within right on the doorstep. The library is located within the British Film Institute (BFI) building and is free to use, and has great wifi, and best of all, a very peaceful and quiet atmosphere. Perfect for anyone who really needs to get their head down and concentrate. One half of the library is free for anyone to use, the other half hosts a wealth of work spaces with power sockets galore dedicated for members only (it takes 30 seconds to sign up).

        <h1>Google Campus Cafe</h1>

        <article>Just minutes from the silicon roundabout, Google Campus Cafe draws hundreds of self-employed / self-studying types and developers every weekday. The space is completely free for anyone to use once they have signed up, which takes just one minute. The free workspace is in the lower-ground floor, which is well lit, and holds an outdoor space for lunch breaks, phone-calls and al-fresco workers. In my experience, the demographic leans heavily towards tech / web developers, so if you are working or studying in software / web, you will meet plenty of like-minded people. There is a strong agenda for networking there too, and they often hold bespoke events for developers and start-ups; from hackathons to investor meet and greets. There are also another 6 or so floors with dedicated paid-for spaces and meeting rooms if things start to really take off for you.
